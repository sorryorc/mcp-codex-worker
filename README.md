Yeah# MCP Codex Worker

Stop spending premium Codex context on bulk code reading, patch loops, and giant diffs.

`mcp-codex-worker` lets Codex delegate the expensive part of a coding task to an async worker running on a cheaper OpenAI-compatible model gateway. Codex stays in charge, but it only receives the compact evidence it needs: changed files, checks, logs, and an optional trimmed diff.

![MCP Codex Worker efficiency lane](docs/efficiency-lane.svg)

## Efficiency First

Most AI coding tools optimize the model call. This project optimizes the route.

The fast path is deliberately split:

- `search` handles repo discovery with zero LLM calls.
- `analyze` and `review` use one cheap gateway call for read-only work.
- `start` moves implementation loops into an async worker so Codex is not blocked by every file read, failed attempt, or test log.
- `get` and `wait` return compact evidence instead of dumping the whole transcript back into the premium thread.

That routing discipline is the efficiency edge: Codex stays focused on planning and review while the worker absorbs the bulky middle.

## The Simple Picture

Without this worker, Codex often pays to ingest everything:

```text
Codex main thread
  -> reads large files
  -> runs repair loops
  -> receives full diffs
  -> burns premium context
```

With this worker, Codex delegates the noisy middle:

  A["Codex<br/>planner and reviewer"] -->|"small MCP start request"| B["MCP Codex Worker"]
  B -->|"launches"| C["Claude Code CLI<br/>background job"]
  C -->|"Anthropic messages"| D["Local adapter"]
  D -->|"OpenAI-compatible chat"| E["Cheap gateway model<br/>DeepSeek / OneAPI / New API"]
  C -->|"git diff + checks"| B
  B -->|"changed_files + checks<br/>optional diff"| A
```

Plain version:

```text
Codex asks: "fix this, run tests"
Worker does: read files -> edit -> test -> summarize
Codex gets: files changed + checks passed + optional diff
```

## Why It Exists

Codex is strongest when it coordinates, reviews, and decides. It is not always cost-effective to make the main Codex thread read huge files, run long repair loops, and ingest giant diffs.

This worker changes the shape of the bill:

- Codex sends a compact `start` request.
- Claude Code does the heavy local work in the background.
- The local adapter routes model traffic to your cheaper backend.
- Codex receives `changed_files`, `checks`, logs, and an optional trimmed diff.

For large code-reading and patching tasks, this can cut the expensive main-thread token intake dramatically because Codex no longer has to ingest every intermediate file read and full patch body.

## What Makes It Better Than "Just Use A Cheaper Model"

Cheap models alone are not enough. You still need routing, safety, result shape, and verification.

This project gives you the missing plumbing:

- A Codex-native MCP interface, so delegation is one tool call.
- A Claude Code execution loop, so the worker can actually edit and test.
- A local Anthropic-to-OpenAI adapter, so Claude Code can use cheaper gateways.
- Scope enforcement and check commands, so work is auditable.
- Compact result payloads, so Codex does not swallow unnecessary tokens.
- Metrics, fallback, retries, and optional worktree isolation for real operations.

## Efficiency Comparison

| Workflow | What usually happens | Efficiency gap | MCP Codex Worker path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct premium-agent coding | The main agent reads files, retries fixes, sees every test log, and ingests large diffs. | Premium context becomes the workspace transcript. | Codex sends one small task; worker returns changed files, checks, logs, and optional diff. |
| Generic cheaper-model wrapper | A cheaper model runs, but the main agent still needs bulky context and manual verification. | Lower model price, same noisy workflow. | Cheap gateway handles bulk tokens; scoped checks and compact results decide whether work is trustworthy. |
| Full agent loop for read-only questions | Starting an edit-capable loop for summaries and discovery. | Slow startup and unnecessary write surface. | `search` is zero-LLM; `analyze`/`review` are read-only cheap calls. |
| Parallel implementation in one repo | Dirty worktrees collide and review payloads grow. | Coordination overhead eats the gain. | Optional worktree isolation plus scoped patch checks keep jobs separable. |

## Highlights

- Async MCP tools: `start`, `get`, `tail`, `wait`, `cancel`.
- Read-only lite tools: `read_pack`, `analyze`, `diff_digest`, `history`, and `draft` keep bulky reading/review/drafting out of the premium thread.
- Code review lite tool: `review` checks diffs/files through the cheap gateway.
- Zero-LLM repo discovery and mechanical work: `search` uses bounded local search, and `apply_edits` handles deterministic replacements without a model call.
- Worker-side command digesting: `shell` can run tests/builds/lint and return a compact failure digest. Non-zero command exits return `status:"failed"` or `status:"timeout"` with `failure_kind` and `required_action`; they are command outcomes, not tool transport errors.
- Receipt abnormal-output assessment: every receipt carries a deterministic accept/repair verdict and bounded repair guidance without default multi-model voting.
- Runtime tool containment: the worker classifies tool errors, opens per-tool/per-error-class circuits, intercepts unhealthy routes, and uses deterministic fallbacks for `review`/`analyze` when the LLM route is unhealthy.
- Reliability tiers and episode summaries: `start` can record `lite`, `standard`, `strict`, or `critical` expectations without blocking old callers; hard rejection happens only with `blocking_policy:"enforce"`.
- Anthropic-to-OpenAI adapter: lets Claude Code talk to OpenAI-compatible gateways.
- 429 and 5xx retry handling with `Retry-After` support.
- Optional `include_diff:false` to return only `changed_files` and `checks`.
- Deterministic verification layer: scope checks, command checks, result signals, and bounded auto-revise.
- Cost telemetry: writes gateway token usage and worker tool-call categories to JSONL when `WORKER_METRICS_FILE` is set.
- Optional fallback gateway when the primary provider fails.
- Optional worktree isolation for parallel jobs inside one repository.
- Secret redaction in logs and tool responses.

## Use Cases

Use it when you want Codex to stay sharp instead of stuffed:

| Task | Normal flow | Worker flow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix a bug in a large repo | Codex reads many files and test outputs | Worker reads/edits/tests, Codex reviews compact result |
| Summarize implementation details | Full agent loop may start | `analyze` calls cheap gateway directly |
| Run repeated repair passes | Main thread absorbs every attempt | Worker handles loop and returns final evidence |
| Parallel scoped edits | One dirty worktree gets tangled | Optional git worktree isolation keeps jobs apart |
| Cost accounting | Claude Code cost may be misleading | Gateway token usage is written to JSONL |

## Tool Surface

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `start` | Start an async Claude Code job in an allowed directory. Supports optional sequential `stages`. |
| `get` | Read current job status and compact structured result; pass `verbose:true` for the full legacy payload. |
| `get_artifact_slice` | Read a bounded redacted slice from an artifact referenced by a worker receipt. |
| `tail` | Read recent worker logs. |
| `wait` | Wait for completion without killing the job on timeout; pass `verbose:true` for the full legacy payload. |
| `cancel` | Kill a running job process tree. |
| `analyze` | Read-only cheap-model analysis for selected files or bounded globs. |
| `review` | Cheap-model review of a job diff/checks or selected files, returning a structured verdict. |
| `search` | Zero-LLM bounded repository search using `rg` when available. |
| `read_pack` | Zero-LLM context packer for selected paths; returns bounded symbol/keyword slices instead of whole files. |
| `diff_digest` | Summarize current git diff by file, hunk headers, and risk; optionally run cheap red-team review. |
| `shell` | Run bounded worker-side commands with optional `digest:true` for test/build/lint output. |

| `history` | Bounded git log/blame timeline for file or line archaeology. |
| `draft` | Draft commit messages, PR descriptions, changelog notes, or release notes from the current diff. |

## Quick Start

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
npm run smoke
```

Create a local `.env` from `.env.example` or set environment variables in your shell. Never commit real keys.

```powershell
setx ONEAPI_API_KEY "your-provider-key"
setx ONEAPI_BASE_URL "https://your-gateway.example.com/v1"
setx SANDBOX_ROOT "D:/workspaces"
```

Then run:

```powershell
npm run doctor
npm run doctor:network
```

## Codex Desktop Config

Copy and adapt `codex-mcp.example.toml` into your Codex config.

```toml
[mcp_servers.codex_async_worker]
command = "node"
args = ["D:/path/to/mcp-codex-worker/dist/index.js"]
cwd = "D:/path/to/mcp-codex-worker"
startup_timeout_sec = 10
tool_timeout_sec = 3600
env = { SANDBOX_ROOT = "D:/workspaces", ONEAPI_BASE_URL = "https://your-gateway.example.com/v1", CLAUDE_MODEL = "deepseek-v4-flash", CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL = "sonnet", CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE = "acceptEdits", USE_OPENAI_ADAPTER = "1", WAIT_DEFAULT_MS = "1800000" }
env_vars = ["ONEAPI_API_KEY"]
```

## Example Job

```json
{
  "prompt": "Fix the failing tests with the smallest safe code change.",
  "allowed_dirs": ["D:/workspaces/my-project"],
  "model": "deepseek-v4-flash",
  "permission_mode": "acceptEdits",
  "include_diff": false,
  "scoped_patch": {
    "paths": ["src", "tests"],
    "max_diff_bytes": 20000
  },
  "checks": [
    { "name": "unit tests", "command": "npm test", "timeout_ms": 600000 }
  ]
}
```

Typical result:

```json
{
  "job_status": "completed",
  "changed_files": ["src/a.ts", "tests/a.test.ts"],
  "checks": ["scoped_patch: passed (src, tests)", "unit tests: passed"],
  "diff": ""
}
```

Use `include_diff:false` by default when Codex only needs to decide whether the job succeeded. Ask for the diff only when you actually need to review patch details.

## Cost Controls

This project stacks several cost controls:

These controls reduce main-thread context, payload size, and accounting noise; they do not impose a spend ceiling on the worker LLM. Primary, fallback, and escalation models are chosen by capability and reliability configuration, not by price gates. `WORKER_PRICE_*` values are for reporting only and must not downgrade, block, or skip fallback/escalation usage.

- `include_diff:false` reduces high-cost Codex ingestion.
- `DIFF_MAX_BYTES` caps patch payloads.
- `INCLUDE_DIFF_DEFAULT=0` makes omitted `include_diff` behave like `false`.
- `CHECK_OUTPUT_RESPONSE_MAX` keeps failed check output compact in `get`/`wait` responses while `tail` retains fuller logs.
- `analyze` skips Claude Code for read-only summaries.
- `search` handles symbol/file discovery without any LLM call.
- `review` and `WORKER_FAILURE_DIGEST=1` move diff review and failure diagnosis to the cheaper gateway.
- `read_pack`, `diff_digest`, `shell digest`, `apply_edits`, `history`, and `draft` move the remaining high-token planning/review chores into worker lanes.
- `WORKER_METRICS_FILE` records real gateway token usage plus `event=tool_call` rows for zero-LLM worker calls.
- `WORKER_ESCALATE_MODEL` upgrades only failed, difficult revise passes.
- `WORKER_RELIABILITY_TIER`, `WORKER_BLOCKING_POLICY`, `WORKER_SEMANTIC_GATE`, and `WORKER_TOOL_BUDGET` record reliability expectations and blocking risk. Defaults are observe-only to avoid surprise stalls.
- `WORKER_ISOLATION=worktree` allows safe parallel work in one repo.
- Prompt-cache-friendly usage keeps stable instructions before dynamic task text.

Claude Code's own `total_cost_usd` may reflect Anthropic pricing, not your gateway pricing. Use `WORKER_METRICS_FILE` and provider prices for real accounting.

## Cost-Saving Checklist

For best results:

1. Set `include_diff:false` for delegated implementation tasks.
2. Keep `scoped_patch.paths` narrow.
3. Add concrete `checks` so the worker proves completion.
4. Use `analyze` for read-only questions.
5. Enable `WORKER_METRICS_FILE` and compare token usage by route/model.
6. Use `read_pack` instead of full-file reads and `diff_digest` instead of full diff ingestion.
7. Use `shell` with `digest:true` for tests/builds/lint so command output is summarized before Codex sees it.
8. Keep `start` below 30% of worker calls; use finer tools for search, reading, diff digestion, history, drafts, and mechanical edits.
9. Treat receipt `abnormal.verdict !== "accept"` as a repair signal before considering multi-model parallel review. For `shell`, use `failure_kind` and `required_action` first; do not escalate to the main model just because the command exit code is non-zero.
10. Use a fit-for-task default model and reserve `WORKER_ESCALATE_MODEL` for difficult revise passes; do not downgrade primary, fallback, or escalation models because of cost.

## Security Model

- All job paths must resolve inside `SANDBOX_ROOT`.
- `scoped_patch` rejects changes outside declared paths.
- `bypassPermissions` is blocked unless explicitly enabled with `ALLOW_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS=1`.
- Secrets are redacted from logs and tool responses.
- `.env`, archives, logs, `node_modules`, and `dist` are gitignored.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure and operational notes.

## Validation

```powershell
npm run build
npm run test
npm run smoke
npm run doctor:network
npm run skills:validate
npm run codex:audit -- --since-minutes=60
npm run codex:guard
```

`doctor:network` depends on your real gateway credentials. Build, test, and smoke should pass offline.

`npm run codex:audit -- --since-minutes=60` checks recent worker metrics, receipt artifact coverage, the persisted `AGENTS.md` routing rules, fallback usage, and worker category evidence. It also prints the known blind spot: direct main-thread shell output, full-file reads, chat context, and pasted prompts are outside `WORKER_METRICS_FILE`.

`npm run codex:guard` runs the local Codex audit and then `stats:gate`.

`npm run skills:validate` checks the project-specific `.claude/skills/` library used to preserve project doctrine for cheaper or lower-context worker sessions.

`npm run stats` reports gateway token usage, receipt byte/artifact usage, and a Worker Tool Audit. `npm run stats:gate -- <metrics.jsonl>` turns the same thresholds into hard gates with exit code 2 on failure. Category targets are: search 80%, context_pack 70%, command_digest 70%, diff_digest 60%, review 60%, mechanical_edit 50%, history 60%, draft 80%, analysis 60%, and `start` must stay at or below 30% of worker calls. Gate mode also fails if required categories have no audit evidence, overall tool error rate is 5% or higher, any single tool error rate is 3% or higher after the sample floor, fallback ratio exceeds 10%, large receipt payloads lack artifact refs, or `diff_digest` red-team coverage falls below 30%. Tool error rate is reserved for worker/tool execution failures; shell command failures are recorded as `command_status` with local repair guidance, and stale job ids or invalid caller inputs are recorded as `rejected`.

When the MCP server is running, it also reviews recent tool error rates every 3 hours by default. A threshold breach, or a review that runs later than `WORKER_TOOL_REVIEW_GRACE_MS`, enables escalation self-heal defaults for later `start` calls: `reliability_tier=strict`, `blocking_policy=warn`, `semantic_gate=warn`, `auto_revise=true`, and at least one revise pass. Explicit `start` arguments still win over these defaults.

Runtime containment is more aggressive than the 3-hour review. Every tool result updates an in-memory rolling window. Real tool execution errors are classified (`upstream_404`, `upstream_error`, `shell_mismatch`, `search_timeout`, `timeout`, `missing_command`, `missing_path`, `permission_denied`, `dependency_missing`, or `unknown_failure`). Repeated errors, or any immediate-class error, open a temporary circuit. While open, unhealthy routes are intercepted as `rejected` instead of producing more errors; `review` and `analyze` degrade to deterministic local evidence when possible. Open circuits and a bounded rolling-event snapshot are persisted to a state sidecar file and reloaded on MCP startup or the next tool-control decision, so restarts do not immediately forget an unhealthy route or a tool already close to its circuit threshold. To keep the hot path cheap, OK outcomes are snapshotted only after `WORKER_TOOL_CIRCUIT_STATE_SAVE_MIN_MS`; errors and circuit opens force a save. Shell command business failures still record `command_status` and do not count as tool errors. On Windows, PowerShell-shaped shell commands accidentally sent through `cmd.exe` are retried once through `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command`.

Additional redundancy that is already in place:

- Gate redundancy: `codex:guard` combines recent routing audit evidence with `stats:gate`.
- Route redundancy: `review`/`analyze` can fall back to local deterministic evidence while LLM review routes are unhealthy.
- Shell redundancy: shell mismatch is retried once through the matching Windows shell before surfacing failure.
- State redundancy: circuit state is atomically written with a temp file plus rename, protected by a best-effort lock, guarded by a checksum, and pruned on load. Corrupt, mismatched, or expired state is ignored and rewritten instead of crashing the MCP server.
- Restart redundancy: a small rolling-event snapshot is restored with open circuits so a restart does not erase tools that are already near a circuit threshold.
- Efficiency guardrail: state writes are bounded by event count and save interval; lock contention skips a snapshot instead of delaying the worker.

The routing contract tests lock the core money/safety invariants:

- I3: no predictive classifier call before routing.
- I5: identical read-only requests hit cache; primary failure plus fallback records one successful upstream.
- I6: read-only tools do not write to the workspace.

The smoke test also verifies the current tool surface: `analyze`, `apply_edits`, `cancel`, `diff_digest`, `draft`, `get`, `get_artifact_slice`, `history`, `read_pack`, `review`, `search`, `shell`, `start`, `tail`, and `wait`.

## When To Use It

Use this worker for:

- long codebase reading tasks,
- scoped code edits with tests,
- repeated repair loops,
- cheap model summaries,
- background implementation while Codex continues planning/reviewing.

Keep the main Codex thread for high-level decisions, code review, final integration, and tasks that require your most capable model directly.
